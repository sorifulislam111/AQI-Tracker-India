## About
The **Air Quality Monitoring Dashboard** is an interactive data visualization tool that tracks and displays real-time air quality information, including pollutants like CO, SO2, NOx, and AQI, across multiple cities in India. This project aims to provide valuable insights into air pollution trends and promote informed decision-making regarding air quality management.

## Project Objective

To develop an interactive Air Quality Monitoring Dashboard that visualizes real-time pollution data, including key pollutants and AQI, across multiple cities. The project aims to raise awareness and provide insights for informed decision-making on air quality management.

## Key Features
- **Real-Time Data Visualization:** Visualize the latest air quality readings in the form of charts and maps.
- **City Comparison:** Compare AQI levels across multiple cities to identify pollution hotspots.
- **Trend Analysis:** Track historical air quality trends over time, offering insights into pollution patterns.
- **Area-Wise Overview:** View a geographical representation of air quality in India.
- **Interactive Filters:** Filter the data based on specific cities and time periods for customized views.
- **Dashboard Insights**:
  - **Air Quality Report**: Displays average values for pollutants like CO, SO2, NO, and PM2.5, providing a snapshot of current air quality.
  - **Top 5 Polluted Cities**: A bar chart showing cities with the highest average AQI.
  - **Least Polluted Cities**: Displays cities with the lowest AQI values.
  - **Area-Wise AQI Overview**: A geographical map showing AQI levels across India. Hover over cities to view detailed data.
  - **AQI Trend Overview**: A line chart showcasing the historical AQI trend, allowing users to track improvements or deterioration over time.

## Technologies Used
- **Data Visualization:** Power BI for interactive visualizations.
- **Data Processing:** Data cleaned and formatted for visualization.
- **Mapping:** Geospatial data representation for geographical insights.

## Data Insights
- **Pollution Levels:** The dashboard highlights average AQI and pollutant readings across different cities, helping users identify pollution hotspots and compare cities' air quality.
- **Geographical Overview:** A map section provides a quick visual assessment of air quality across various regions, aiding in identifying areas in need of intervention.
- **Historical AQI Trends:** Track long-term changes in air quality to identify improvements or worsening pollution levels over time.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project can be found [here](https://github.com/sorifulislam111/AQI-Tracker-India/blob/main/City_AQI_Data_India.csv). It contains air quality readings for multiple cities in India, including key pollutants such as CO, SO2, NOx, and the AQI. The data is provided in a CSV format, with daily records.
