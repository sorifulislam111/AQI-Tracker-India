## About
The **Air Quality Monitoring Dashboard** is an interactive data visualization tool that tracks and displays real-time air quality information, including pollutants like CO, SO2, NOx, and AQI, across multiple cities in India. This project aims to provide valuable insights into air pollution trends and promote informed decision-making regarding air quality management.

## Project Objective

To develop an interactive Air Quality Monitoring Dashboard that visualizes real-time pollution data, including key pollutants and AQI, across multiple cities. The project aims to raise awareness and provide insights for informed decision-making on air quality management.

## Key Features
- **Real-Time Data Visualization:** Visualize the latest air quality readings in the form of charts and maps.
- **City Comparison:** Compare AQI levels across multiple cities to identify pollution hotspots.
- **Trend Analysis:** Track historical air quality trends over time, offering insights into pollution patterns.
- **Area-Wise Overview:** View a geographical representation of air quality in India.
- **Interactive Filters:** Filter the data based on specific cities and time periods for customized views.

## Technologies Used
- **Data Visualization:** Power BI for interactive visualizations.
- **Data Processing:** Data cleaned and formatted for visualization.
- **Mapping:** Geospatial data representation for geographical insights.

## Data Insights
- **Pollution Levels:** Highlights average AQI and pollutant readings across different cities.
- **Geographical Overview:** A map section displays air quality across various regions, offering a quick visual assessment of pollution levels.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project can be found [here](https://github.com/sorifulislam111/AQI-Tracker-India/blob/main/City_AQI_Data_India.csv). It contains air quality readings for multiple cities in India, including key pollutants such as CO, SO2, NOx, and the AQI. The data is provided in a CSV format, with daily records.
